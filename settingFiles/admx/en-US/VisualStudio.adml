If set to 1 (enabled), then the Visual Studio installer will remove all out-of-support components during all subsequent updates.  
        
If set to 0 (disabled) or missing entirely, then the remove out-of-support components behavior will respect other locations where this can be configured, such as commandline parameter or the Update Settings dialog.
        
This functionality requires the Visual Studio 2022 version 17.4 installer to be installed on the client machine.

If set to 1 (enabled) then the Visual Studio user does not want to receive administrator updates to Visual Studio. This policy is for the developer user to set if they have admin permissions on the client machine.

      <string id="DisableRollback_Explain">This policy determines whether the user can undo an update and rollback Visual Studio to the previously installed version.

      <string id="LiveShare_DomainName_DisplayName">Allow only company domain accounts</string>
      <string id="LiveShare_DomainName_Explain">Prevents users from being able to share their session with any guests who are not part of their company or any other company that has been given access.

      <string id="LiveShare_DirectConnectionMode_DisplayName">Require direct connection</string>
      <string id="LiveShare_DirectConnectionMode_Explain">Prevents hosts from allowing relay-based guests from joining their session.

      <string id="LiveShare_GuestApprovalRequired_DisplayName">Require guest approval</string>
      <string id="LiveShare_GuestApprovalRequired_Explain">Guest can join the session only after host approves. Live Share already has the “Live Share: Guest Approval required” setting, and so this policy is effectively just enforcing that to “true”.

      <string id="LiveShare_DisableSharedServer_DisplayName">Disable shared server</string>
      <string id="LiveShare_DisableSharedServer_Explain">Prevent the host from being able to explicitly share a new server. The policy also enforces “Live Share: Auto Share Servers” setting to false.
